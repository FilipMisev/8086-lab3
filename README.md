Write a program segment that will compare 2 strings, one of which is password. Both strings should be entered in memory locations as desired. The comparison is it does byte by byte and if the strings are different it is printed on the user screen 'N', and if they are the same, write 'D'. To check the operation of the program, so that for password, the word 'MPSPOTPISI' will be entered, and for the second string the words: 'MICROPOTPISI'; 'MPSPOTPISI'; 'MPSPOTPIS', for three consecutive executions.
